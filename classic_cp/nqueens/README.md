# n queens problem

The nqueens problem is the generalization of the well known 8 queens problem on a n*n chess board. The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
